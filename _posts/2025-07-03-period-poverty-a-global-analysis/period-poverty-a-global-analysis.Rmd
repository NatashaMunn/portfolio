My idea to investigate period poverty came from an interest in the stigma surrounding it in society. I feel passionately about the importance of starting conversations and breaking the stigma. I want my video to act as a wake-up call for people who take their access to period care for granted.

The first area I researched was the cost of periods across the globe. I considered this a good jumping-off point because it observed the problem globally and examined what I believe to be one of the most pressing issues of period poverty: *cost*.

This visualisation was created using [***DataWrapper***](https://www.datawrapper.de/), which made it easy to import the data for period cost per country into a world map visualisation. This also allowed for features such as text annotations, colour legends, highlighting over hover, and interactive visualisation. Check it out!

However, I knew the topic was much deeper than just money. This brought me to ideas such as the stigma surrounding periods and the effect on young people and their education. I presented these data sets using Canva's built-in chart designs, which were extremely easy to use and manipulate!

I used [***Canva Video Editor***](https://www.canva.com/video-editor/) to create my final project, a software I am familiar with and love using for my communications projects. I was thoughtful with my editing decisions and worked hard to create something that looked professionally presented, easily understandable, and stylised well. I achieved this through simple background music, sound, animation, slide transitions, colour, and graphics. I also made sure to structure my argument thoughtfully and concisely by covering my introduction and three main topics, then ending with a conclusion and solutions to solve the problem.

This was such an enjoyable project to work on. I loved combining statistical analysis with visual storytelling and communications. It proved an excellent opportunity to combine my two majors and use data and statistics in a communications setting.

Overall, I hope my video educates people on this stigmatised topic of period poverty through data storytelling. Enjoy!
