Kia ora! My name is Natasha. I am a third year student at the University of Auckland majoring in Statistics and Communications. I am passionate about learning and further developing the skills I have acquired throughout my degree. I have created this blog as a space to demonstrate my learning, document my progress, and have fun with data analysis and digital communications.
